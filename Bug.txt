1- The task counter is off by one.
It starts counting tasks from -1 instead of 0, so the total task count is always incorrect by 1.

2- The text "Double-Click to edit a toodo" is misspelled.
It should be "Double-click to edit a todo."

3- Hard to read.
The text color makes it difficult to read.

4- Clear button.
The clear button only clears tasks that are active.

5- Dropdown arrow.
The dropdown arrow marks all tasks as complete, which is not expected. A standard dropdown arrow is typically used to expand or collapse content.
